kurento-rtp-relay
===================

A simple RTP Video Relay example for Kurento Media Server.
This example is based on kurento-hello-world example, and connects and WebRtcEndpoint
to a RtpEndpoint, which acts like a bridge to any destination capable of processing
RTP video.

This was tested in a scenario where kurento media server and kurent-rtp-relay app
both run in the same machine. Also, the destination machine
(the one which the RTP video flow is sent to) was in the same network.
